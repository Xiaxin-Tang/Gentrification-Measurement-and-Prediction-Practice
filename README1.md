## 1 Introduction

Gentrification, a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, significantly impacts urban landscapes and communities. Recent studies and reports from Philadelphia serve as a poignant example of these transformations. The displacement of lower-income, predominantly black and Latino residents due to rising housing costs highlights the critical socioeconomic shifts occurring within gentrifying neighborhoods [^1]. This displacement is often juxtaposed with the economic benefits perceived through extensive urban development and increased safety.

Interactive analyses, visually demonstrate the expansion of gentrification across Philadelphia, showing stark increases in housing prices and changing socioeconomic statuses [^2]. Moreover, the construction boom of 2019 set records, particularly in neighborhoods around Center City, further indicating areas undergoing significant gentrification [^3]. This development brings into question the balance between growth and the preservation of community identity and accessibility.

This project aims to develop a predictive model for gentrification, using Philadelphia as a case study to identify at-risk areas, thereby enabling proactive urban planning and policy-making. Through a combination of spatial and non-spatial data analysis, this study will explore how gentrification can be measured and predicted, offering insights that could inform decisions to mitigate its adverse effects.
